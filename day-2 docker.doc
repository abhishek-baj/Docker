Docker installtion :

I will not mention  below there is link  : given 
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/




some basic commands of docker:

1) docker ps : This command basically used to check the process status. 

2) docker ps -a : This command will pull  request from first input of status process.

2) docker pull: the name of the image, we can pull that from the Docker hub using the command docker pull
                         docker pull --platform linux/x86_64 mysql

3) docker images: we should have some images in our local machine, and to confirm, let’s run the following command to list all the local images.
                                   command: docker images

4) docker run : we have some images, we can try to create a container.env option to set a mandatory environment variable and --detach option to run the container in the background.
                              RUN command: docker run --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw --detach mysql
                              
                              

5) docker stop: To stop a container, use the docker stop command with either the container id or container name. We may stop a container if we want to change our docker run command.


6)docker exec: Access the running container test_db by running the following command. It’s helpful if we want to access the MySQL command line and execute MySQL queries.
                               docker exec: docker exec -it test_db bash
                                            mysql -uroot -pmy-secret-pw
                                            SHOW DATABASES;

7) docker logs: This command is helpful to debug our Docker containers. It will fetch logs from a specified container.
                    docker logs : docker logs test_db


8) docker rm: In case we want to remove a container.


9)  docker rmi: Finally, if we want to free some disk space, we can use the docker rmi command with the image id to remove an image.
                           docker rmi: docker rmi eb0e825dc3cf 


10) docker kill: This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately.
                   docker kill: docker kill <container id>


11)docker commit: This command creates a new image of an edited container on the local system.
                     dcoker commit: docker commit <conatainer id> <username/imagename>




12) docker login: This command is used to login to the docker hub repository.
                   

13) docker push: his command is used to push an image to the docker hub repository.
                  dcoker push: docker push <username/image name>


14) docker build: This command is used to build an image from a specified docker file.
                 docker build: docker build <path to docker file>




>> These are basic command that we used  in docker .
